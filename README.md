# minecraft_bevy
## Minecraft_bevy was built to showcase [bevy_meshem](https://github.com/Adamkob12/bevy_meshem). After a week of developing it has:
### ***Chunk loading / unloading*** 
each chunk's mesh is being generated by bevy_meshem, generating thousands of meshes per frame.
### ***Block placing / breaking*** 
using bevy_meshem's 0.2 release that made run-time mesh updates possible, block placing and breaking feels smooth and snappy.
### ***Custom Collision physics*** 
without any 3rd party crates / physics engines.
